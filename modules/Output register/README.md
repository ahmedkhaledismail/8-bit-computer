# Output register
The output register is similar to any other register (like the A and B registers) except rather than displaying its contents in binary on 8 LEDs, it displays its contents in decimal on a 7-segment display. <br/>

We are using the EEPROM for programming the data to be printed on the 7-segments. You can find the EEPROM programmer schematic, Arduino code, and more by visiting the [EEPROM programmer](../EEPROM%20programmer/) section.
